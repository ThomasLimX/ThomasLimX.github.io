    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
        The following three professional portfolio sites inspired me in creating my website:
        <ol>
            <li><b><a href="https://activetheory.net/" target="_blank">Active Theory.net</a></b> - Active Theory uses an interactive design to immerse users in their website, this has inspired me to aim for my portfolio to be engaging. By learning subtle interactivity from their hover effects and dynamic transitions. These features can enhance the users to experience a immersive storytelling, making their site 
            memorable. The use of a DNA structure as their storytelling approach, by scrolling down you are able to see their progress as a company to reach who they are today. Despite these complex animations and interactions that I have encountered as a user. One of the clear focus that I am able to see is their website is clear and intuitive. What I can gather from going through their website is the importance of structuring a website in a way that allows users to explore and be immerse with the content. They also remove any confusion by having a top to bottom narrative, this is what I will envision for my portfolio as I want users to be able to learn about my journey from the start till the end. Those unfamiliar with intricate web designs would be able to understand their progression as a company through this format.
            </li><br>
            <li><b><a href="https://www.jessicahernandez.me/" target="_blank">Jessica Hernandez</a></b>- After viewing Jessica Hernandez, she uses a clean and minimalist approach when creating her portfolio which keeps users to focus on her content. Even though her pages might be 'wordy', it allows me to be engaged with the site itself by having interactive elements. I learned that you can make a website with unnecessary elements similar to the first site that I mentioned. Having a clearer and impactful presentation with minimal designs, this approach taught me that I dont need to have a flashy and heavy effects to portray myself as a programmer. She is able to highlight her projects using a project-centric focus which is a clear description but also engaging users to find out more about her portfolio. This allow me to approach my website with a clearer goal in mind of what I want to portray on each of my webpage. Having more effects, animation and information does not mean that it will be useful in portraying your portfolio as users might be lost in understanding you as a person in your own website. However, visual appeal is one of the main factor that I have learnt from viewing a professional web developer portfolio
            </li><br>
            <li><b><a href="https://www.jessicahernandez.me/" target="_blank">James Williams</a></b> - After viewing James's portfolio, I was able to see a perfect balance between creativity and informative. His website is on a professional level that showcase using a monochrome design with the incorporation of the first site and the second site. James is able to portray appealing animations in a simplistic way that is both informative and intriguing. It has the information that is from site 2 and the appealing design from site 1. His project section has a tab like animation which showcase his different projects when you scroll down. He inherit the web site structure of website 1 from the top to bottom layout. This has inspired me to be more confident with my visual design choices by using bold colours. Colours being a factor ,using professional images is also a way to attract users to be interested. It is able to portray James's personal brand and his skills as a web developer. He effectively weaves his personal stories through his website, only showing his important projects and accomplishment. This storytelling is straightforward with texts and images, this maintains a clear and intuitive navigation. When I look through his portfolio, I am able to gather what he is proficient as a programmer as well as a person. I would love to adapt his visions and importance of balancing design, functionality and content. This site took me 5-10 mins to understand what James is able to deliver and portray whereas I took more time to understand the other 2 websites. 
            </li><br>
            <li>Conclusion: After going through these 3 websites ,  I have chosen to take inspiration from website 3 as James is able to engage users like me through simplicity and minimalistic visuals. This helped me realise the power of engaging users through different methods of representing their content in different format. The reason of choosing site 3 is because is more project-centric and summarized. Being able to understand who and what the programmer have accomplished in a short duration of time is important. Not everyone has the attention span to scroll a long website or read a paragraph. James's website is able to compress all of these information into a short and informative portfolio which impressed me. Hence his website is my main focus of inspiration </li>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        I have taken into account accessibility by:
        <ol>
            <li>I have chosen color contrast for visual impairments, my site use an appropriate color to contrast between my text and background elements. 
                For example, I have use a dark text on a light background and vice versa in dark mode ensures that users with visual 
                impairments or color blindness can comfortably read the content without straining their eyes. After viewing site 3, this is what I structure my colour scheme to ahere to.
            </li><br>
            <li>I have ensure that my website supports keyboard navigation through interactive elements such as links as button. This is critical for users who have limited motor abilities or rely on keyboards instead of a mouse. The navigation bar and scrollable elements that are designed with accessibility when I was making it.
                This is to allow users to access all content using the keyboard.
            </li><br>
            <li>Screen reader compatibility, I have included alternative text for all my images and labels for form elements. This will allow my website is accessible to users who rely on screen readers. This will help the visually impaired users 
                that understand the content and navigate the site effectively.
            </li><br>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <p>
        I considered the usability of my site in the following ways:
        <ol>
            <li>I have allowed my site to adapt to various screen sizes, to ensure a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This responsiveness is critical for usability as it allows
                users on different devices to access the site without any functionality or content loss. Allow users to view the content fully without lacking any information on different devices.
            </li><br>
            <li>My navigation menu is simple and intuitive with clear labeled links to different sections like "Homes" , "Projects", and "Contact". This ensures that users can quickly find the information
                that they need without looking through every single page of the website.The mobile menu uses a toggle for easy access, improving usability for mobile users.
            </li><br>
            <li>I have also implemented a theme toggle feature, allowing users to switch between dark and light modes. This allow me to enhances visual comfort for users in different lighting environmenets but also makes the 
                site more accessible and usable for my users with specific visual preferences. Which mode is more pleasing to their eyes or which mode does not strain their eyes.  </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
        During the creation of my site, I had to learn or explore the following:
        <ol>
            <li>I learn to create responsive grid layouts, particularly for the bento box section. This is to ensure that it adapts well to different screen. It is one of the famouse style for 
                different size grids which is called the bento box style. I achieved this by CSS grid and Flexbox and testing different layouts across devices. Slowly refining the structure until 
                the bentobox is smoothly on both desktop and mobile views. 
            </li><br>
            <li>JavaScript for theme toggling and interactivity, I implement this in my dark/light theme toggle, I had to learn how to dynamically apply css classes using JavaScript by researching JavaScript DOM manipulation 
                and experimenting with different implementations. This theme switcher that I implemented enhances my user accessibility and experience. Taking inspirtaion from sites that has a toggle for light and dark mode, 
                seeing their colour schemes that will be appleasing to the user's eyes 
            </li><br>
            <li>I ensure my site is accesible to users with disabilities. This required me to learning about accessibility standards, such as using appropriate colour contrasts and ensuring there is keyboard navigation.
                I referred heavily to resources like Web content accessibility guidelines and tested my site using tools like screen readers and accessibility checkers to ensure my site is fully accesible to a wide array of users.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <p>
        The aspects of my portfolio that were particularly successful include:
        <ul>
            <li>I was able to apply responsive layout to all my webpages. This ensures that the content and design look and function well across different devices and screen sizes, from mobile
                phones to desktops. This adaptability provides a seamless user experience for a wide audience. This is one of the main focus I had for my project, which is to ensure responsive layout for my website for all pages. </li><br>
            <li>I was able to produce a clean and modern design combined with subtle interactivity similarly to the site that I took inspiration from. Using a flash light animation, hover effects and transitions. This have helped me make my site visually engaging 
                without all my content being overwhelming. Giving my site a professional feel and engaging users when they navigate through my site. 
            </li><br>
            <li>The implementation of the dark/light theme toggle was one of the most difficult challengning features that I have encountered. Being able to toggle is easy as is using the root element to change the colour, however the challenging portion is to keep the dark and light mode to stick throughout the entire website.
                Having this feature, I would need to create DOM element to allow my themes to stick to each webpage. Having this feature, allows users to choose their visual style that suits them best. Allowing a comfortable browsing experience for my portfolio </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
    <p>
        Some aspects that could be improved include:
        <ul>
            <li>I feel that my logos for my main page can be better as the logos is moving from left to right. When the screen is 1100px, the logo will disappear. However, I overcome this by having logos on my footer. I feel that this can be further improve by changing my images or having different structure to showcase this feature.
                 </li><br>
            <li>My project sections should have more interactive elements other than the popout. Including live demos of my work so that user can interact with it directly. Having a more detailed case study and outline of my project development process and challenges. These enhnacement would provide deeper insights and expertise of myself as a programmer. I am not able to do that yet as I am currently still learning how to be a programmer </li><br>
            <li>My about section can be further elaborate by using having more information about myself as a programmer, having a timeline or career path. I do not want too much information for my website as I want to keep it short and simple.However this can be further improve by structuring my content appropriately with more given time.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
